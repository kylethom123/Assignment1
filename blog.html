   <h1> blog 1: HTMl and Server basics</h1>
   <a href="https://kylethom123.github.io">Link to index.html</a>
   <p1>The most challenging part of this assignment was definitley try to figure out how to work with git and the repositiores. It was challenging to figure out to clone,update and push the code and impleting the pages aspect of git also came with its own struggles</p1>
   <p2>I learned alot about git and github during this assignement. I got a little review on html, but I need to practice and study it alot more.</p2>
   <p3>I went to the TA office hours to get a little more help trying to publish my code on git hub pages which was helpful. I would say that the most helpful tools can be found online either through the class website or just googling it.</p3>

<h2> blog 2: CSS </h2>
<a href="https://kylethom123.github.io/myAssignment2/">Link to Assignment 2</a>
<p1> This assignment was very difficult and eyeopening, Although I dont currently understand a lot of the functionallity of CSS </p1>
<p2> I didlearn that there is quite alot of capabilities that one day I will hopefully understand. This assignment definitley caught me off gaurd with </p2>
<p3> the change in workload from Assignment 1 but now I know what to expect so I can do much better on the next one.</p3>


<h2> blog 3: Java </h2>

<p1> This assignment was AWESOME, I was an idiot and pretty much waited to the last day to start it but it was actually super cool to learn how java CSS and html interacted with each other.</p1>
<p2> It kinda felt like I was actually using my computer as it was intended to be used for the first time ever. Now as I type this I feel like I am begining to gain some small comprehension of how the internet works and how I can add stuff to it. </p2>
<p3>It was pretty challenging to initially figure out how to make changes on diffrent elements but once I understood the syntax I kinda took off.</p3>
<p4>My favorite part by far though was working with Emmanuel to implemet the search function, he helped show me alot of cool recources that I can use when I get stuck, and generally changed my problem solving process</p4>
<p5>Some of my favorite things I learned today were how to inspect on safari and how to find the declaration of a function or variable using the command button.</p5>

<h2> blog 4: Node </h2>
<p1> I enjoyed this assigment. The biggest challenge with HTML,Java and CSS for me is learning the vocabulary.  </p1>
<p2> It feels like if I don't know the commands to access the information I want to use, so to remedy this I often visit the Enginering center and get some help</p2>
<p3> I think the class notes are a good place to get started but I had to further increase my understanding with google and people in the center</p3>
